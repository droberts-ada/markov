TODO List 5/10:
- Handle punctuation (period, comma, citation, etc)
  - Tokenization
  - Artifact generation
- Capitalization (input and output)
- Finish with a period
  - Limit is soft, find the last period and go until the next period, figure out which gets you closer to the goal
  - Increase the probability of a period around the word count.
- Multi-token history (input and output)
- Get more / better test data

Vocab list
- Source document / document: one thing to read
- Text: a string representing the un-processed words of a source document
- Token: the generator's representation of a bit of text. Could be a literal (the word itself) or an escape
- Tokenize: turn a text into a list of tokens
- Escape: a non-literal token. In angle brackets, representing things like punctuation, new paragraphs, or wikipedia citation markers.
- Transition: each token gets a set of transitions, representing the probability of hopping to other possible tokens
- Target: a possible token that you might hop to. Coupled with a probability it makes a transition
- Artifact: a string generated by this program
- Assemble: turn a list of tokens into an artifact (lots of de-escaping, mucking with whitespace, etc)
